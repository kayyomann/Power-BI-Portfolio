# Maven Market Dashboard

The **Maven Market Dashboard** was developed to provide key insights for a multi-national grocery chain with locations across Canada, Mexico, and the United States. The primary goal was to help the management team effectively track important KPIs (transactions, profits, and returns), compare regional performance, analyze top-performing products, and identify high-value customers.

## Goals
- **Track KPIs**: Provide real-time visibility into monthly transactions, profits, and returns.
- **Regional Comparison**: Enable management to easily compare performance across different countries and regions.
- **Product Analysis**: Highlight top-performing products based on sales, profit margins, and return rates.
- **Customer Insights**: Identify high-value customers to optimize marketing strategies and drive business growth.

## Business Needs
Management needed a centralized solution to monitor key metrics across all locations, understand regional performance, and optimize product strategies. By closely tracking return rates and product margins, Maven Market sought to minimize losses and maximize profitability across their operations.

## Discovering and Presenting Insights
- **Data Exploration**: Raw CSV files containing inventory, sales, stores, products, and calendar information were processed and analyzed to uncover trends, anomalies, and high-value opportunities.
- **Visual Representation**: Interactive visualizations, including KPI cards, maps, bar charts, and gauges, were used to present meaningful insights. This enabled the management team to quickly digest data, make comparisons, and spot areas for improvement or growth.
- **Actionable Insights**: By analyzing the data, the dashboard revealed which products were driving the most profit, which regions were underperforming, and where operational efficiency could be improved. This empowered Maven Market to take strategic action.
