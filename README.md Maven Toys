# Maven Toys Executive Dashboard

The **Maven Toys Executive Dashboard** was designed to provide the leadership team with a simple, interactive way to track key business metrics. This dashboard delivers a comprehensive overview of monthly orders, revenue, profits, and top-performing product categories, all filtered by store location. It's a streamlined tool for monitoring high-level trends and performance across multiple stores.

## Goals:
- **Track KPIs**: Monitor total monthly orders, revenue, and profits across different store locations and product categories.
- **Regional Comparison**: Provide a breakdown of store performance based on location, allowing leadership to focus on airport, commercial, downtown, and residential areas.
- **Product Insights**: Highlight the top-performing product categories such as toys, arts & crafts, games, sports & outdoors, and electronics, giving clear insight into what drives sales.
- **Time-Based Analysis**: Include a visual representation of revenue trends over time, allowing users to track performance across the months.

## Business Needs:
Leadership required a clear, easy-to-understand tool to evaluate store performance and adjust strategies as needed. The goal was to provide concise, high-level metrics that would allow leadership to quickly identify areas of success or concern. Identifying top-performing product categories and store locations ensures that leadership can focus on growth opportunities and operational improvements.

## How Insights Were Discovered:
I organized transaction records from January 2022 to September 2023 along with product and store location data to build a complete picture of the business.

By creating interactive visuals for key metrics like revenue and orders, I enabled leadership to explore the data dynamically, helping them understand trends and identify key areas for improvement. Leveraging filters like store location (Airport, Commercial, Downtown, Residential), I allowed for focused analysis on how different store types were performing.
