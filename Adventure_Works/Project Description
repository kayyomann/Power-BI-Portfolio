# Maximizing Sales Potential: A Comprehensive Dashboard for AdventureWorks

## Project Overview
As part of my role as a Business Intelligence Analyst at AdventureWorks, a global manufacturing company specializing in cycling equipment, I developed a Power BI dashboard to help the management team effectively track key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total orders, revenue, profit, and return rates. The project aimed to facilitate the comparison of regional performance, analyze product trends, and identify high-value customers.

## Data Source
The data for this project was sourced from the companyâ€™s local data repository, comprising multiple raw CSV files. These files contained information on:
- Transactions
- Product details
- Customer demographics
- Returns and sales transactions

The dataset spanned from 2020 to 2021, with lookup tables for products, customers, and a calendar, alongside fact tables for sales and returns data.

## Methodology
1. **Data Import & Transformation**: 
   - Imported data into Power BI.
   - Cleaned and transformed the data by removing duplicates, handling missing values, and converting data types.
   - Joined necessary columns and created calculated columns for year-over-year growth.

2. **DAX Measures & Relationships**:
   - Developed DAX measures to compute KPIs like total revenue, average sales per customer, and profit margins.
   - Established relationships between sales and returns fact tables with lookup tables for products and customers, ensuring accurate data analysis.

## Visualizations & Reporting
To present the insights effectively, I designed an interactive dashboard using Power BI, which included:
- **Line & Area Charts**: Visualizing trends over time for sales and revenue.
- **Bar Charts**: Displaying monthly sales performance.
- **Pie Charts**: Showing the contribution of product categories.
- **Geographic Maps**: Highlighting regional sales performance.
- **KPI Cards & Gauges**: Showing key metrics at a glance.
- **Matrix**: Providing detailed cross-tabular analysis.
- **Slicers & Sliders**: Enabling easy filtering and time-period adjustments.

The dashboard was structured across four pages:
1. **Customer Detail Page**: Showcasing customer segmentation.
2. **Product Detail Page**: Offering deep insights into product performance.
3. **Regional Sales Maps**: Visualizing sales across different regions.
4. **Executive Dashboard**: Summarizing the main KPIs for quick decision-making.

## Key Findings
- **Sales Peaks & Dips**: Identified seasonal sales patterns, with peaks during the holiday season.
- **High-Value Customers**: Segmented customers based on purchasing behavior, highlighting those contributing the most to revenue.
- **Regional Performance**: Revealed underperforming regions, guiding targeted marketing and sales efforts.
- **Product Trends**: Identified best-selling and underperforming products, informing inventory management and product development.

## Impact
The insights from this project enabled the management team to make data-driven decisions, optimizing sales strategies and improving profitability. The ability to drill down into specific regions, products, and customer segments allowed for more focused marketing and resource allocation, ultimately leading to more efficient business operations.
